DESCRIPTION:Like many of you\, the organization I work for is deeply invest
 ed in an ecosystem other than Elixir\, in our case Rails. However\, we have
  lots of engineers interested in Elixir. The question: how do we get the re
 st of the developers interested and convince the bosses that Elixir is a wo
 rthwhile technology to invest in? \n\nIn deciding what to do\, we had to co
 nsider the potential impact to our service (the Boss really frowns on takin
 g down the site and annoying paying customers)\, the scope of the project (
 the Boss frowns on developers disappearing for a month to play with cool sh
 iny things)\, intriguing the other engineers (engineers like cool shiny thi
 ngs). Balancing all these concerns was the key in getting buy-in from every
 one. \n\nWe decided to build a status monitoring device using Nerves that s
 hows the high level health of our app at a glance. We have LED strips showi
 ng recent apdex scores for our app (via NewRelic’s API)\, recent error rate
 s (from Honeybadger)\, and the status of recent builds (from CircleCI)\, al
 ong with a big red flashing light for when Pingdom says our site is down. \
 n\nFor about $100 in parts\, and a couple weekends of hacking\, we built an
  appliance that was useful to the organization\, showed off the power of El
 ixir/OTP\, and was just darn cool! \n\nIn this talk\, I'll go through how w
 e created the appliance\, the things we learned\, and how this was a great 
 project for introducing Elixir to the company. We’ll discuss why a Nerves b
 ased hardware project made sense given what we wanted to accomplish and the
  level of Elixir chops on the team. We’ll walk through the initial proposed
  design\, and talk about how it evolved as we actually wrote the code. Fina
 lly we’ll take a look at the source code we ended up with\, and see the mon
 itor in all its glory.
