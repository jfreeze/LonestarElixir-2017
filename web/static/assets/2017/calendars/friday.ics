DESCRIPTION:Developing "hardware and hardware accessories" can be difficult
  and time consuming. Until now\, you would have to constantly swap SD cards
  or create and push full firmware updates in order to iterate on your devic
 e. We want to make the development cycle as comfortable as possible by marr
 ying the fundamentals of Erlang hot code reloading with connected Hardware 
 in the Loop (HIL). Together\, we will explore the Nerves development cycle 
 through live demonstrations from mix nerves.new to mix firmware. Furthermor
 e\, we will push live code updates and even leverage the Phoenix Live Reloa
 der on the Target. Finally\, we will take a peek at executing ExUnit tests 
 on connected hardware.

DESCRIPTION:Like many of you\, the organization I work for is deeply invest
 ed in an ecosystem other than Elixir\, in our case Rails. However\, we have
  lots of engineers interested in Elixir. The question: how do we get the re
 st of the developers interested and convince the bosses that Elixir is a wo
 rthwhile technology to invest in? \n\nIn deciding what to do\, we had to co
 nsider the potential impact to our service (the Boss really frowns on takin
 g down the site and annoying paying customers)\, the scope of the project (
 the Boss frowns on developers disappearing for a month to play with cool sh
 iny things)\, intriguing the other engineers (engineers like cool shiny thi
 ngs). Balancing all these concerns was the key in getting buy-in from every
 one. \n\nWe decided to build a status monitoring device using Nerves that s
 hows the high level health of our app at a glance. We have LED strips showi
 ng recent apdex scores for our app (via NewRelic’s API)\, recent error rate
 s (from Honeybadger)\, and the status of recent builds (from CircleCI)\, al
 ong with a big red flashing light for when Pingdom says our site is down. \
 n\nFor about $100 in parts\, and a couple weekends of hacking\, we built an
  appliance that was useful to the organization\, showed off the power of El
 ixir/OTP\, and was just darn cool! \n\nIn this talk\, I'll go through how w
 e created the appliance\, the things we learned\, and how this was a great 
 project for introducing Elixir to the company. We’ll discuss why a Nerves b
 ased hardware project made sense given what we wanted to accomplish and the
  level of Elixir chops on the team. We’ll walk through the initial proposed
  design\, and talk about how it evolved as we actually wrote the code. Fina
 lly we’ll take a look at the source code we ended up with\, and see the mon
 itor in all its glory.

DESCRIPTION:Elixir is an elegant and powerful language. This makes the Rasp
 berry Pi a usable server for Elixir Applications. What would happen if we h
 ad a cluster of Raspberry Pi devices? Can Elixir and OTP help with the dist
 ribution of the application? What would you do with a 16 core and 4 GB of R
 AM machine? \n\nI’ll explore different techniques to deploy to a Raspberry 
 Pi Cluster and how we can use the Elixir processes to balance the load betw
 een the devices.

DESCRIPTION:“Why do you stick everything in a database?” —Joe Armstrong\n\n
 \nModern application development can be tough. You need to remember things 
 with long term storage\, you need short term storage for the times when tha
 t’s too slow\, and you need another kind of storage just to remember who yo
 u are currently talking to. This process is obsolete. \n\nElixir affords us
  other options in designing our applications. We have ready access to: \nAc
 cumulate only data stores\nBuilt-in caching via `ets`\nHot code reloading\n
 These tools make it simpler to spend effort solving problems instead of wor
 king to satisfy some request/response cycle. \n\nThrough a sample applicati
 on\, we will explore these techniques and hone our recognition of when it’s
  possible to bypass complexity with straightforward data flows. \n\nMake yo
 ur apps run on state instead of CRUD.
