DESCRIPTION:With Elixir and Phoenix\, the toolkit for building web applicat
 ions has expanded dramatically. Beyond Phoenix's routers and controllers aw
 aits a whole new world of features and ways to build reliable systems. With
  this talk\, you'll see how. \n\nWhen learning or adopting a new language\,
  you naturally draw on your existing domain knowledge as a stepping stone. 
 Building a web app in one language is much like building one in another. Yo
 u handle requests\, responses\, and for most languages\, give little though
 t to stateful processes and long-running subsystems. However\, with Elixir 
 and Phoenix everything is different. We can compose applications using isol
 ated\, stateful subsystems that a regular stateless request can interact wi
 th and leverage. \n\nOver the course of the talk we will take a practical a
 pproach to building a small application in Elixir\, walking through all the
  steps and describing what language features we are taking advantage of and
  why. Along the way we'll explore GenServer\, OTP\, backpressure management
 \, synchronous vs asynchronous calls\, a testing strategy\, and integration
  into a Phoenix application. \n\nThe end result is a fully functional Elixi
 r project\, integrated into a Phoenix application.
