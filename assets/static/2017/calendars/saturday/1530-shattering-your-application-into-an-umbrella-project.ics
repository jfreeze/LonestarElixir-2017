DESCRIPTION:With the announcement of Phoenix 1.3 supporting umbrella projec
 ts at ElixirConf 2016\, I was inspired to start early on converting our Pho
 enix 1.2 application to umbrella. Since the umbrella project templates were
 n't publicly available yet\, I had to find the seams in our single\, monoli
 thic application where I could start breaking it into OTP apps for the umbr
 ella project. \n\nI'll cover the thought process of how I broke up the app 
 and what guidelines I use now when adding new code as to whether add it to 
 a pre-existing application or to make a new OTP application. I'll share the
  common code I was able to share between our RPC server and API controllers
 \, which I believe is a good behaviour for resource module in Phoenix 1.3.
