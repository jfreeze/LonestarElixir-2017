DESCRIPTION:“Why do you stick everything in a database?” —Joe Armstrong\n\n
 \nModern application development can be tough. You need to remember things 
 with long term storage\, you need short term storage for the times when tha
 t’s too slow\, and you need another kind of storage just to remember who yo
 u are currently talking to. This process is obsolete. \n\nElixir affords us
  other options in designing our applications. We have ready access to: \nAc
 cumulate only data stores\nBuilt-in caching via `ets`\nHot code reloading\n
 These tools make it simpler to spend effort solving problems instead of wor
 king to satisfy some request/response cycle. \n\nThrough a sample applicati
 on\, we will explore these techniques and hone our recognition of when it’s
  possible to bypass complexity with straightforward data flows. \n\nMake yo
 ur apps run on state instead of CRUD.
