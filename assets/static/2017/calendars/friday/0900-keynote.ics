DESCRIPTION:Developing "hardware and hardware accessories" can be difficult
  and time consuming. Until now\, you would have to constantly swap SD cards
  or create and push full firmware updates in order to iterate on your devic
 e. We want to make the development cycle as comfortable as possible by marr
 ying the fundamentals of Erlang hot code reloading with connected Hardware 
 in the Loop (HIL). Together\, we will explore the Nerves development cycle 
 through live demonstrations from mix nerves.new to mix firmware. Furthermor
 e\, we will push live code updates and even leverage the Phoenix Live Reloa
 der on the Target. Finally\, we will take a peek at executing ExUnit tests 
 on connected hardware.
